Course: CS 300 â€“ Data Structures and Algorithms
ðŸš€ Overview
This repository contains two related projects for the ABCU (ABC University) Advising Assistance Program:

âœ… Project One: Pseudocode design and runtime analysis

âœ… Project Two: Full C++ implementation of the designed system

These projects work together to build a course planning system that helps academic advisors retrieve, sort, and display course information, including prerequisites, using a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient data access.

ðŸ§  Project One Highlights
Document: ProjectOne_Pseudocode.docx

Designed data loading, sorting, and search algorithms using pseudocode

Compared three data structures: Vector, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree

Analyzed Big O runtime:

Total Runtime: O(nÂ·k + nÂ·log(n))
Recommended the use of Binary Search Tree (BST) for its efficient and ordered traversal features.

ðŸ’» Project Two Highlights
File: ProjectTwo.cpp

Fully functional command-line program written in C++

Implements:

  * File input and parsing from CSV

  * Binary Search Tree to store and sort course data

  * In-order traversal to print courses in alphanumeric order

  * Search function to display course info and prerequisites

  * Mimics real-world advising tool functionality

Follows best practices:

  * Modular code structure

  * In-line documentation

  * Input validation
